## Data Base ##
Two free data sets were used to generate movie database:

    https://datasets.imdbws.com/

    https://data.world/priyankad0993/top-50-imdb-movies-based-on-ratings/workspace/file?filename=Top+IMDB+Movies.xlsx

Two tables were cleaned and merged, then created build script called 'database_build_script'
Run script in SSMS to build movie database. (There should be 35 rows)
